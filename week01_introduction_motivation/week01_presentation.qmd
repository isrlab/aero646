### Key idea:
- Learn a function
- Evaluate its performance
- Ensure it generalizes beyond training data

## What is Machine Learning? (contd.)

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

:::{.fragment}
**Traditional Programming:**

- Input (Data) + Program (Rules) → Output (Prediction)
- E.g. 
    - Input: 1,2,3,4, ....
    - Program: $f(x) = 2x+1$ [We code this]{.highlight}
    - Output: 3,5,7,9, ...
:::

:::{.fragment}
**Machine Learning:**

- Input (Data) + Output (Labels) → Program (Model)
- E.g.
    - Input: 1,2,3,4, ...
    - Output: 3,5,7,9, ...
    - Program: ML [learns]{.highlight} $f(x) = 2x+1$ from the data
:::
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
:::{.fragment}
:::{.incremental}
**A Generalized Function Approximation**

- ML can be treated as a function approximation technique
- Except input/output data can be of any data type
    - Images
    - Sounds
    - etc.
- ML [learns]{.highlight} the relationship between input and output data
    - can be used to [predict/generate]{.highlight} outputs from other inputs
    - we may not capture the relation exactly
      - prediction will have errors!

## What Machine Learning Is NOT

:::{.fragment}
### Machine learning is not:
- Magic
- A substitute for understanding physics
- Guaranteed to extrapolate correctly
- Automatically safe or robust
:::

:::{.fragment}
### In aerospace:
- Validation is critical
- Extrapolation is dangerous
- [Guarantees matter]{.highlight}
:::

---

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning: Learn from labeled data 
  - Regression (continuous outputs)
  - Classification (discrete labels) 

### Unsupervised Learning: Find patterns in unlabeled data 
  - Clustering
  - Dimensionality reduction

### Reinforcement Learning: Learn by trial and error
  - Sequential decision making

---

## Supervised Learning (Examples)

### Labeled Inputs → Outputs

**Examples:**

- (Geometry, Mach number) → Lift coefficient
- Sensor measurements → Flight regime
- Telemetry → Fault / no-fault

**You define:**

- Inputs
- Outputs
- Performance metric

---

## Unsupervised Learning (Examples)

### No labeled outputs

**Examples:**

- Grouping flight trajectories
- Identifying maneuver types
- Discovering dominant flow structures

**Goal:**

- Find structure in data
- Reduce dimensionality

---

## Reinforcement Learning (Examples)
### Learns via Interaction

**Basic Idea:**

- Agent interacts with a system
- Receives rewards
- Learns a policy -- like a controller or guidance algorithm

**Examples:**

- Autopilot tuning
- Trajectory optimization

---

## The Machine Learning Pipeline

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
### A typical workflow:

1. Problem formulation
2. Data collection
3. Preprocessing
4. Model selection
5. Training
6. Validation and testing
7. Interpretation and deployment
:::
::: {.column .fragment}
### Most failures occur at:
- Step 1 (wrong question)
- Step 6 (poor validation)
:::
::: 


---


## Why is ML Hard in Aerospace?

- Data is expensive and sparse (flight tests, wind tunnels)
- Safety-critical: mistakes can cost lives
- Physics-based constraints: not all patterns are physically meaningful
- Certification and regulation (FAA, NASA)
- Real-time and embedded requirements

:::{.fragment}
### Why Validation Matters in Aerospace 

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
**Aerospace systems are:**

- Safety-critical
- Operated outside training data
- Sensitive to uncertainty
:::
::: {.column}
**Key questions:**

- Does the model generalize?
- How sensitive is it to noise?
- What happens outside the data range?
:::
::: 
:::

:::{.fragment}
> A hybrid approach of [physics + data]{.highlight} driven machine learning is likely to work better for aerospace systems.
:::

## Ethics and Responsibility in Aerospace ML

:::{.fragment}
### Machine learning can influence:
- Control decisions
- Navigation and guidance
- Fault detection and isolation
- Autonomous behavior
:::

:::{.fragment}
### Errors can cost lives, assets, or strategic stability
- Would you trust an ML autopilot? Why or why not?
- How do we ensure safety, transparency, and accountability?
- What are the risks of bias or overfitting in safety-critical systems?
:::

:::{.fragment}
### What Makes Aerospace ML Different (from consumer ML)?

- Smaller datasets
- Rare but catastrophic failure modes
- Operation outside training conditions
- Strong coupling with physical systems
:::

:::{.fragment}
> Ethical responsibility is inseparable from engineering responsibility.
:::

---

## Ethics and Responsibility in Aerospace ML (contd.)

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
### Core Ethical Questions
When deploying ML in aerospace, ask:

- Can this system fail safely?
- Do we understand when it will fail?
- Who is accountable for decisions?
- Can humans intervene?
- Are the assumptions documented?

:::{.fragment}
### Data Ethics
- Data quality and representativeness
- Bias in training data
- Missing or censored failure cases
- Simulation vs real-world mismatch

A model trained on biased data -> produces biased decisions
:::
:::
::: {.column}
:::{.fragment}
### Example: Biased Flight Data
If training data includes:

- Only nominal flight conditions
- Few extreme maneuvers
- Limited environmental variation

Then the model may:

- Perform well in tests
- Fail catastrophically in edge cases
:::

:::{.fragment}
### Model Transparency and Interpretability
Important questions:

- Can we explain model outputs?
- Do engineers understand failure modes?
- Is debugging possible?

Black-box models:

- May be acceptable for analysis
- Are dangerous for closed-loop control
:::
:::
:::

--- 

## Verification and Validation (V&V)
::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

:::{.fragment}

### Traditional aerospace V&V
- Analytical guarantees
- Worst-case analysis
- Structured testing

### ML challenges

- Statistical performance $\neq$ safety guarantee
- No universal stability guarantees
:::
:::

::: {.column}
:::{.fragment}
### Validation Is [Not Optional]{.highlight}
High test accuracy does NOT imply:

- Robustness
- Safety
- Reliability

Ethical deployment requires:

- Stress testing
- Uncertainty analysis
- Out-of-distribution evaluation
:::
:::
:::

---

## Human-in-the-Loop Responsibility

### Critical design choice:
- Fully autonomous?
- Human-supervised?
- Human override capability?

### Ethical principle:
> ML should assist decision-making, not obscure it

---

## Automation Bias

### Risk:
- Humans over-trust ML outputs
- Operators defer judgment to the algorithm

### Mitigation:
- Clear confidence measures
- Training users to question outputs
- Explicit failure indicators

---

## Fault Detection and False Confidence

### In aerospace:
- False negatives can be catastrophic
- False positives can cause mission aborts

### Ethical tradeoff:
- Conservative models vs operational efficiency
- Transparency about detection limits

---


## Responsibility and Accountability

### When ML fails, who is responsible?
- The algorithm designer?
- The system integrator?
- The operator?
- The organization?

### Ethical engineering requires:
- Clear responsibility chains
- Documented assumptions

---

## ML in Autonomous Systems

As machine learning becomes more deeply integrated into autonomous aerospace systems, several unique challenges and risks must be considered:

:::{.fragment}
### Escalation of autonomy:
  - Systems may transition from human-supervised to fully autonomous operation, sometimes without clear boundaries or sufficient oversight.
  - Increased autonomy can outpace regulatory frameworks and operator understanding, raising questions about control, intervention, and accountability.
  - Example: An autopilot that adapts its own logic in flight, making decisions beyond its original certification.
:::

:::{.fragment}
### Unexpected emergent behavior:
  - Complex ML models can exhibit behaviors not anticipated during design or testing, especially when exposed to novel situations or data distributions.
  - These emergent behaviors may be beneficial, neutral, or hazardous, and are often difficult to predict or diagnose.
  - Example: Anomaly detection system that misclassifies rare but critical events, or a control system that exploits loopholes in its reward function.
:::

:::{.fragment}
### Limited real-time interpretability:
  - Many ML models, especially deep neural networks, act as "black boxes," making it hard for engineers and operators to understand or trust their decisions in real time.
  - Lack of interpretability can hinder rapid troubleshooting, regulatory approval, and safe human-machine teaming.
  - Example: A flight control system issues a corrective action, but the rationale is opaque to the pilot and ground crew.
:::

:::{.fragment}
> Design principle: Autonomy must degrade gracefully
