```
weekXX_topic/
├── weekXX_presentation.md      # Main slide content
├── weekXX_demo.ipynb          # Interactive demonstrations  
├── weekXX_exercises.ipynb     # Student practice problems
├── data/                      # Aerospace datasets
├── images/                    # Supporting visuals
└── instructor_notes.md        # Teaching guidance
```

### Next Development Priorities
